# Technical HomeTests Already Done
This sole purpose of this repo is to bundle together all the home tests that I have implemented in the last few months so that if you are looking for help in your team we can jump straight to that decent conversation between developers and skip the part where I work for free.

## Do you need help with your project and on the lookout for a new software developer?
Great! Hello visitor :) My name is Gabi and I am a professional Software Developer since 2008. I work only remotely now and I am constantly investing time and work in my own professional advancement. This will benefit me and you as a potential collaboration. I work with decent and compasionate people and help them create that product they are really passionate about.

## What projects you will see
The projects are around Backend (Java11, SpringBoot, Postgresql, Flyway), Frontend (Html+CSS, JavaScript, React.js) and possible other languages or platforms, for instance a test project for an Android Developer opportunity.

## More projects
Some of my side-projects are open sourced on my Github projects. Latest projects:

# Pick a pair mate
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pick-a-pair-mate?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-pick-a-pair-mate" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=268932&theme=light" alt="Pick a pair mate - Generate a unique pair of names without analytics spying. | Product Hunt" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" width="250" height="54" /></a>

Generate a unique pair of names from your input. You only need unique pairs for whatever (your own situation). The project does not track the users in any shape or form.
It's intentional created this way, because we, as you are probably, tired of forever online tracking from other services, even for the most simplest of actions.

The web app is hosted on Vercel:  [PickAPairMate](https://pickapair.vercel.app/)

# One-page React.Js themes

I love dribbble.com and occasionally browse around there for design inspiration. I wanted to practice writing CSS and creating layouts, so I chose some website designs to try to reproduce them in code. 
Until now, I have a one-page lifestyle type a blog <span style="font-weight: bold">[[storyreacttheme]]{: .internal-link}</span> and a minimal blog <span style="font-weight: bold">[[blogreacttheme]]{: .internal-link}</span>. 
I made them Github Templates, so you can start your own project with any of the templates and see results in minutes.

Would you like to see a specific web design implemented? You can create a new issue in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/daisygabi/reactjsonepagethemes) and maybe it will be created.
